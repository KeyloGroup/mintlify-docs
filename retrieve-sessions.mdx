# Retrieve Sessions

Use this endpoint to retrieve the sessions stored for a specific workspace.

This is the primary “read” endpoint for sessions and is typically used to:
- populate dashboards
- load recent session history
- retrieve the session closest to a given timestamp (via `start_time`)

---

## Endpoint

**GET** `/sessions/list/{workspaceId}`

---

## Authentication

This endpoint requires an API key.

You must provide your workspace API key using the header:

- **Header:** `x-api-key`
- **Value:** `<your-api-key>`

If the API key is missing or invalid, the API will return **401 Unauthorized**.

---

## Path Parameters

### `workspaceId` (required)

The workspace identifier that owns the sessions table.

- **Type:** `string`
- **Example:** `b0a6c81e-2d5d-4f29-bb4b-9a1e0d9f6c11`

---

## Query Parameters

### `start_time` (optional)

If provided, the API returns the session whose `start_time` is **closest** to the timestamp you send.

- **Type:** `string`
- **Format:** `date-time` (ISO 8601)
- **Example:** `2026-02-14T18:30:00Z`

#### Behavior notes
When `start_time` is included:

- the API calculates the absolute time difference between each stored session and the requested timestamp
- it returns the **single closest session**
- results are ordered by smallest time difference

When `start_time` is **not** included:

- the API returns **all sessions**
- ordered by `start_time DESC` (most recent first)
